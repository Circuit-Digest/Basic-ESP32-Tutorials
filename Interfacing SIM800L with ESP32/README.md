 Let's say you are trying to build a remote IoT data monitoring system, the first problem you will face is how to get a 
 proper internet connection for your device. Whether you want to get notified when someone enters your room or you want 
 to water your plants from miles away, the internet is always a problem. In this type of situation, SIM800L GSM/GPRS Module
 can come in very handy. SIM800L is a very compact GSM/GPRS module that can be integrated into a lot of IoT projects due to 
 its compact size and flexibility. This module can do anything that a normal cell phone can do like text message, make and 
 receive phone calls and connect to the internet through GPRS and on top of that, it supports quad-band GSM/GPRS means it
 can work anywhere in the world.
