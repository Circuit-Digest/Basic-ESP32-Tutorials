There are times when you need something to happen, on time, every time. Thatâ€™s where timers and timer interrupts come to play. A timer is a kind of interrupt. It is like a simple clock which is used to measure and control time events. providing a precise time delay. Most microcontrollers have inbuilt timers. The timers in microcontrollers are used not only to generate time delays but also as a counter. This characteristic of the timer is used for many applications. The timers in the microcontroller are controlled by special function registers that are assigned for timer operations.
The ESP32 chip contains two hardware timer groups. Each group has two general-purpose hardware timers. They are all 64-bit generic timers based on 16-bit prescalers and 64-bit up / down counters which are capable of being auto-reloaded.
