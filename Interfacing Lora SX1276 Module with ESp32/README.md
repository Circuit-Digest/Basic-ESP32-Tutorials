When we are talking about LoRa it's been more than 10 years since its first official launch and since that day LoRa is getting 
increasingly popular day by day.  With so many IoT devices popping around this, this low power long-range wireless communication 
could fit into a plethora of applications. It is expected that by 2025 we will have 29 Billion devices connected to the internet. 
To give you an idea that is more than four times the population of earth today. 

So in this tutorial we have decided to set up the populer HDPA13A that is a SX1276 LoRa end Node with ESP32 and send data to the 
TTN network, to do so we will be using the RG186 LoRa Gateway which we learned how to set up in one of our previous projects. 
We will also be setting up the populer SX1276, 868MHz LoRa end node module that we will configure to work with INDIAâ€™s Standards. 
Finally we will be discussing the problems we have faced and the solution we found to establish communication with The Things Network. 
so without further ado let's get right into it.
