Drones rely on various sensors to maintain stable flight, especially when GPS is unavailable or unreliable. One important feature is position holding, where the drone stays in one place without drifting. This is crucial for indoor navigation, hovering, and precision landing. Optical flow sensors, like the PMW3901, help drones achieve this by tracking motion relative to the ground.

The PMW3901 is a small, low-power optical flow sensor that measures movement by analysing surface patterns. It is widely used in robotics, drones, and automation to estimate position changes without GPS. This makes it an excellent choice for applications requiring precise motion tracking. In this guide, we will explore the PMW3901 sensor, its specifications, and how to interface it with ESP32.
