As we know In this tutorial, we are going to look at the ESP RainMaker. ESP RainMaker is the end-to-end platform for the ESP chips from Experessif. It is designed as a successor to Experessifâ€™s ESP Jumpstart platform. ESP RainMaker enables customers to quickly design, build and deploy AIoT solutions based on enterprise-level cloud computing without the hassle of managing any infrastructure. It is a collection of device-agent SDK, a transparent cloud application and iOS/Android phone apps. This lets developers write the firmware and instantaneously interact with it through the phone apps or voice assistants without writing a single line of code in the cloud or the phone applications. Makers can just focus on developing their firmware without worrying about the app or cloud integration and the rest of the infrastructure. 
The ESP Rainmaker is similar to other IoT services like the Blynk application, Ubidots, Thingspeak, IFTTT and Arduino IoT cloud etc. But this platform offers features much more such as self-adapting mobile apps, free integration of Alexa and Google Assistant, Node sharing, Wi-Fi provisioning through QR code and much more. The great attribute of using this IoT platform is that it is free for its users and offers great features.
